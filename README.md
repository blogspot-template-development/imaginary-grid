<h2>About theme</h2>

<p>I introduce Imaginary with grid design (two columns index page) for Japanese and English.</p>

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nagahitoyuki/imaginary-grid/master/imaginary.jpg" alt="Header of Imaginary with grid design">

<h3>Some features</h3>

<ul><li>Lazy load image of post snippets</li><li>Infinite scroll in index pages</li><li>Floating back button (at the bottom right of the blog except its header) in all pages</li><li>Share button for apps in all pages on mobile</li></ul>

<h3>Sample blog</h3>

<ul><li><a href="https://imaginary-theme.blogspot.com/">One of Imaginary series for Japanese</a> </li></ul>

<p>There are <a href="https://github.com/nagahitoyuki/imaginary-liquid">liquid</a> and grid types in Imaginary series. Basic performance is all the same, but design may vary by type or version.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.nagahitoyuki.com/p/imaginary-theme-for-blogger.html">The explanation of Japanese version</a> is also posted on my Japanese blog.</p>

<p>I hope you enjoy this Imaginary in your Blogger / blogspot blog.</p>
